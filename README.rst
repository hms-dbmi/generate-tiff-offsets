generate-tiff-offsets
============================================
A cli tool for generating IFD offsets within a tiff file, useful for optimizing load times of remote tiff files in viewers like `viv <https://github.com/hms-dbmi/viv>`_.  An `offsets.json` file is written out adjacent to the input file in the folder from which the original file comes.  This is exactly what a tool like `Avivator <http://avivator.gehlenborglab.org>`_ expects for viewing remote data.
